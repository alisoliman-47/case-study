      "0039 | \n",
      "0040 | Giardia duodenalis is a common enteric protozoan parasite that is categorized into eight assemblages (A–H). In particular, assemblages A and B are zoonotic, capable of infecting both humans and animals worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses and public health challenges in epidemic regions. Thus, the development of rapid, accurate and non-laboratory-based diagnostic methods for infected animals is crucial for the effective prevention and control of giardiasis. Recent advancements in clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein (Cas12a) systems allow promising avenues for nucleic acid detection, characterized by their high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity.\n",

The REPORT‑based G. duodenalis assemblage A and assemblage B detection methods have strong specificity and no cross-reactivity with other assemblages of G. duodenalis or common enteric parasitic protozoa and have excellent performance in clinical sample detection.\n",

      "0071 | Giardia duodenalis is one of the most common enteric protozoan parasites and infects humans and over 40 animal species [1]. Asymptomatic giardiasis frequently occurs in immunocompetent individuals; however, more severe symptoms like aqueous diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, nutrient malabsorption and even death are often observed in immunocompromised patients [2, 3]. Infection with G. duodenalis happens through ingestion of contaminated food or water or via the fecal-oral route through host-to-host contacts [4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that approximately 200 million people worldwide are infected with this disease [5]. Currently, at least eight assemblages (A–H) of G. duodenalis have been identified, with assemblages A and B recognized as zoonotic and documented in both humans and various animal species [6].\n",
      "0072 | \n",
      "0073 | Currently, available techniques such as microscopy, immunology-based assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) have multiple drawbacks, including being time- and labor-intensive, lacking specificity and sensitivity [7–9] and requiring expensive equipment and well-trained personnel [10–12]. Novel methods such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) operate under isothermal conditions, making them most suitable for on-site detection [13, 14]. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need for detection methods that are more sensitive, time-efficient, labor-saving and visual and less dependent on instrumentation for routine laboratory and field tests [15].\n",
      "0074 | \n",
      "0075 | Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against invading nucleic acids [16, 17]. Cas12 and Cas13, members of the Cas family, are capable of generating collateral cleavage of DNA and RNA, respectively [18–20]. When combined with RPA pre-amplification, Cas13 and Cas12a nucleases have been utilized to develop the Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) system and the DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter (DETECTR) system for highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid detection [18, 21]. In the CRISPR/Cas12a system, the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) specifically binds to target nucleic acids to form a ternary complex composed of Cas12a protein, guide RNA (gRNA) and the target nucleic acids. This complex exhibits robust collateral cleavage activity, indiscriminately cleaving surrounding nontarget single-stranded nucleic acids [20, 21]. The CRISPR/Cas12a system has been widely used to detect various pathogens such as Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) [22], African swine fever virus (ASFV) [23], beta-coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 [24] and Bacillus anthracis [25]. In this study, a combined recombinase polymerase amplification and the CRISPR/Cas12a system (termed REPORT) detection technique was established by observing fluorescence readouts under blue light or using a lateral flow strip (LFS) biosensor to distinguish G. duodenalis assemblage A and assemblage B for rapid, specific, accurate and sensitive detection.\n",

The transformed bacteria were cultured overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid medium at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm. Following this, the bacteria were serially diluted tenfold, and 100 μl of each dilution was inoculated onto LB solid medium, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The bacterial concentration, expressed as colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml), was determined by counting the colonies on the LB solid medium. Additionally, plasmid DNA was extracted using a rapid DNA extraction method, which involved cleaning and re-suspending the bacteria, incubating them at 95 °C for 10 min and then subjecting them to an ice bath for 2 min [26].\n",

      "0092 | \n",
      "0093 | Four gene loci (SSU rRNA, β-giardin, glutamate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase) were commonly used in the identification of G. duodenalis [3]. Triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) gene was selected as the target for the design of crRNAs, because the assemblage-specific crRNAs were only screened at the tpi gene. Then, the 20–24 nucleotide (nt) sequence closely following a TTN protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) was selected as the target sequence, with a GC base content between 40 and 60%. A ‘synthetic mismatch’ was introduced into the crRNA-A1, which did not affect the crRNA's ability to recognize the target sequence of assemblage A, causing assemblage F to have two adjacent mismatched leads to off-target [29]. The T7 promoter (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) was utilized to generate the scaffold sequence of FnCas12a (AATTTCTACTGTTGTAGAT) and the target sequence (20–24 bp after the target PAM sequence) of crRNA-F, which exhibited inverse complementarity to crRNA-R, as previously described. The two single-stranded crRNA-F/Rs were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) and annealed to form double-stranded crRNA, which was transcribed using a HiScribe™ T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA), digested using Recombinant DNase I (RNase-free) purchased from TaKaRa Bio Inc. (Dalian, China) and purified by NucAway™ Spin Column purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA) to obtain pure crRNA (Additional file: Table S1).

      "0101 | The FnCas12a trans‑cleavage assay was performed as previously reported, with some optimization [21, 30]. The 20-μl reaction system included 50 nM FnCas12a (Tolo Biotech, Shanghai, China), 1 μM purified crRNA, 1.25 μM single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe [HEX-12N-BHQ1 reporter and FAM-12N-biotin reporter were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) and used for the fluorescence assay and the LFS assay], 2 μl 10 × FnCas12a nuclease reaction buffer, 2 μl target DNA (RPA products), 20 U RNase inhibitor (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Dalian, China) and DNase/RNase-free water (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., China). Reaction conditions were maintained at 37 °C for 2 h. A qTOWER3G qPCR system (Analytik Jena, Germany) was used to record the fluorescence every 5 min and generate real-time fluorescence curves.\n",

      "0104 | \n",
      "0105 | To achieve on-site diagnosis of G. duodenalis assemblages A and B, the LFS was used. The FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter could specifically bind to an anti-FITC antibody conjugated with Au nanoparticles. When the trans‑cleavage function of FnCas12a was not activated by the target DNA, the complex (FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter with anti-FITC antibody) was captured by the biotin ligand fixed on the control line. However, FnCas12a activated by the target DNA exerts its trans‑cleavage function to cut the ssDNA reporter, and the complex cannot be captured by the biotin ligand fixed on the control line but by the IgG antibody at the test line. Determination of test results was conducted as follows: if the control line on the test strip turned red while the detection line exhibited no color change, the test result was determined as negative. Conversely, if both the control and detection lines turned red, the test sample was classified as positive. Following the completion of the FnCas12a trans‑cleavage assay, 4 μl of the reaction mixture was combined with 196 μl of diluent; subsequently, 80 μl of this mixture was absorbed and added to the LFS. The LFS was then incubated at 25 °C for 7 to 10 min to allow for result observation.\n",

The primers used for the nested PCR are listed in Additional file: Table S1 and synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The 25 μl nested PCR reaction system included 1 × KOD-Plus buffer, 0.5 units KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (ToYoBo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), 200 μM dNTPs, 500 nM of each primer, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 μl DNA template and ddH2O.

      "0131 | In the LFS assay, when the concentration of the FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter is low, the Au nanoparticles will not completely combine to the anti-FITC antibody, and then free Au nanoparticles flowing forward and being captured by the anti-FAM secondary antibody at the test line will lead to a false-positive result. To avoid this, five different concentrations of the FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter between 5 and 50 nM were tested on LFS without interference from any target DNA samples. The test results showed that false-positive results would appear when the concentration of FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter was ≤ 15 nM and disappear when the concentration of FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter was ≥ 20 nM (Fig. 3). Therefore, the concentration of the FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter was determined to be 20 nM in REPORT-based LFS detection.Fig. 3 Optimization of reporter concentration for REPORT-based LFS detection. Various concentrations of the FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter were tested to avoid false-positive results. 1–7: 5 nM, 10 nM, 15 nM, 20 nM, 30 nM, 40 nM and 50 nM FAM-12N-biotin ssDNA reporter\n",

      "0135 | Based on the REPORT system, this study aimed to establish a detection technique to distinguish G. duodenalis assemblage A and assemblage B, and the results could be read out by fluorescence and test strips. The designed crRNA with FnCas12a binds to the target dsDNA to form a triplex, which activates FnCas12a. Next, the activated FnCas12a will perform trans-cleavage to cleave the HEX-12N-BHQ1 reporter to emit 520-nm fluorescence under 488-nm light or cleave the FAM-12N-biotin reporter to display a test line on the LFS. Using the positive DNA samples of G. duodenalis assemblages A or B as templates, RPA and enzyme digestion were performed using F35/R267 primers and crRNA-A1, F125/R287 primers and crRNA-B1, respectively. The CRISPR/Cas12a-based fluorescence detection assay was placed under a blue light instrument. The products of positive samples emitted clear, visibly detectable fluorescence, which was significantly different from that of the negative control (Fig. 4a and c). In the LFS assay, a red line visible to the naked eye appeared in the test line on the LFS of the positive sample. In contrast, no color change was observed in the test line of the negative sample on the LFS (Fig. 4b and d).Fig. 4 Feasibility verification of the REPORT-based detection. a Obvious fluorescence signal can be observed under UV light by the naked eye for assemblage A. A1: positive results, A2: positive results. b An obvious test line can be observed in the LFS of assemblage A. c An obvious fluorescence signal can be observed under UV light by the naked eye in assemblage B.

In the REPORT‑based assemblage A detection method, only G. duodenalis assemblage A showed high fluorescence intensity differences from other parasites (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 5a and b). The G. duodenalis assemblage A emitted a visible green fluorescence and test line that could be distinguished by the naked eye (Fig. 5c and d). Similarly, the result of the REPORT‑based assemblage B detection method showed that assemblage B had high fluorescence intensity (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 5e and f), a visible green fluorescence and test line different from other parasites (Fig. 5g and 5h).Fig. 5 Specificity of REPORT-based detection.
